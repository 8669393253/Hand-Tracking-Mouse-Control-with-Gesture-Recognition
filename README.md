# Hand-Tracking-Mouse-Control-with-Gesture-Recognition
This Python project uses MediaPipe, OpenCV, and PyAutoGUI to enable hand-tracking-based mouse control. The program tracks the position of the index finger and allows for simulating mouse clicks using a pinch gesture between the thumb and index finger. The movement of the index finger controls the cursor, and a pinch gesture triggers a click.
